# Day 1: Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data

## Project: Band Name Generator

### Description
A simple interactive Python program that generates a creative band name based on user input. The program combines the name of the city where the user grew up with their pet's name to create a unique band name.

### What I Learned
- Working with variables in Python
- Using the `input()` function to get user input
- String concatenation
- f-string formatting for cleaner output
- Basic print statements

### How to Run
```bash
python3 day1_app.py
```

### Example Usage
```
Welcome to the Band Name Generator.
What's name of the city you grew up in?
> Seattle
What's your pet's name?
> Buddy

Thank you for using the Band Name Generator.
Your new band name is: Seattle Buddy!
```

### Key Concepts
- Variables store data that can be used later in the program
- User input can be captured and stored in variables
- f-strings provide an elegant way to format strings with variables
