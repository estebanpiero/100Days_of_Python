# Day 2: Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings

## Project: Tip Calculator

### Description
An interactive tip calculator that helps users calculate how much each person should pay when splitting a bill. The program takes the total bill amount, desired tip percentage, and number of people, then calculates the amount each person owes.

### What I Learned
- Python data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans)
- Type checking and type conversion
- String manipulation and indexing
- Mathematical operations and PEMDAS order
- f-string formatting with decimal precision
- Working with the `round()` function
- Basic arithmetic operations

### How to Run
```bash
python3 Day2_app.py
```

### Example Usage
```
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $150.00
What percentage tip would you like to give? 15, 18, or 20? 18
How many people to split the bill? 5

Each person should pay: $35.40
```

### Key Concepts
- **Data Types**: Understanding int, float, str, and bool
- **Type Conversion**: Converting between different data types
- **String Indexing**: Accessing individual characters in strings
- **Mathematical Operations**: Addition, multiplication, division, and exponentiation
- **Formatting**: Using f-strings with precision control (`.2f`)

### Additional Examples in Code
The file also includes commented examples demonstrating:
- String manipulation and indexing
- Large integer formatting with underscores
- Type errors and how to avoid them
- String methods (lower, upper, count)
- BMI calculator implementation
