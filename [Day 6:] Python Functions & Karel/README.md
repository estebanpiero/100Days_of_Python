# Day 6: Python Functions & Karel

## Project: Karel Challenges (Reeborg's World)

### Description
This day focuses on learning Python functions through Karel-style challenges on Reeborg's World, an online platform for learning programming through robot navigation puzzles. The exercises teach function definition, calling functions, and code organization.

### What I Learned
- Defining functions with `def`
- Calling functions
- Code reusability and organization
- Function-based problem solving
- While loops for repetitive tasks
- Breaking down complex problems into smaller functions

### Files
- `day6.py`: Basic function definition and calling
- `reeborg_world.py`: Solutions to Reeborg's World challenges

### Key Concepts
- **Function Definition**: Creating reusable code blocks
- **Function Calls**: Executing defined functions
- **Code Organization**: Breaking complex tasks into smaller, manageable functions
- **DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself - using functions to avoid code duplication

### Example
```python
def my_function():
    print("Hello World")

my_function()
```

### Learning Platform
These challenges are designed to work with [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html), an interactive platform where you control a robot using Python functions to navigate mazes and complete tasks.

### Skills Developed
- Creating custom functions
- Understanding function flow
- Problem decomposition
- Algorithmic thinking
